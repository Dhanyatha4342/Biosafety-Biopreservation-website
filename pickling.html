            <h1>PICKLING</h1>
            <p>Pickled products truly add spice to meals and snacks. The skillful blending of spices, sugar and vinegar with fruits and vegetables creates a crisp, firm texture and a pungent, sweet-sour flavor. Although food markets today offer a wide variety of pickles and relishes, many consumers like to make their own pickled products when garden vegetables and fresh fruits are in abundant supply. Various types of pickled products can be made depending on the ingredients used and methods of preparation.</p>

                    <h1>General Information on Pickling</h1>
                    <p>The many varieties of pickled and fermented foods are classified by ingredients and method of preparation.

<br><br>Regular dill pickles and sauerkraut are fermented and cured for about 3 weeks. Refrigerator dills are fermented for about 1 week. During curing, colors and flavors change and acidity increases. Fresh-pack or quick-process pickles are not fermented; some are brined several hours or overnight, then drained and covered with vinegar and seasonings. Fruit pickles usually are prepared by heating fruit in a seasoned syrup acidified with either lemon juice or vinegar. Relishes are made from chopped fruits and vegetables that are cooked with seasonings and vinegar.

<br><br>Be sure to remove and discard a 1/16-inch slice from the blossom end of fresh cucumbers. Blossoms may contain an enzyme which causes excessive softening of pickles.

<br><br>Caution: The level of acidity in a pickled product is as important to its safety as it is to taste and texture.

<br>Do not alter vinegar, food, or water proportions in a recipe or use a vinegar with unknown acidity.
<br>Use only recipes with tested proportions of ingredients.
<br>There must be a minimum, uniform level of acid throughout the mixed product to prevent the growth of botulinum bacteria.
<br><br>Ingredients

<br>Select fresh, firm fruits or vegetables free of spoilage. Measure or weigh amounts carefully, because the proportion of fresh food to other ingredients will affect flavor and, in many instances, safety.

<br>Use canning or pickling salt. Noncaking material added to other salts may make the brine cloudy. Since flake salt varies in density, it is not recommended for making pickled and fermented foods. White granulated and brown sugars are most often used. Corn syrup and honey, unless called for in reliable recipes, may produce undesirable flavors. White distilled and cider vinegars of 5 percent acidity (50 grain) are recommended. White vinegar is usually preferred when light color is desirable, as is the case with fruits and cauliflower.

<br>Pickles with reduced salt content

<br>Recipes for pickles with reduced sodium content are provided in Guide 6 of the USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.

<br><br>In the making of fresh-pack pickles, cucumbers are acidified quickly with vinegar. Use only tested recipes formulated to produce the proper acidity. While these pickles may be prepared safely with reduced or no salt, their quality may be noticeably lower. Both texture and flavor may be slightly, but noticeably, different than expected. You may wish to make small quantities first to determine if you like them.

<br><br>However, the salt used in making fermented sauerkraut and brined pickles not only provides characteristic flavor but also is vital to safety and texture. In fermented foods, salt favors the growth of desirable bacteria while inhibiting the growth of others. Caution: Do not attempt to make sauerkraut or fermented pickles by cutting back on the salt required.

<br><br>Firming agents

<br>Alum may be safely used to firm fermented pickles. However, it is unnecessary and is not included in the recipes in this publication. Alum does not improve the firmness of quick-process pickles. The calcium in lime definitely improves pickle firmness. Food-grade lime may be used as a lime-water solution for soaking fresh cucumbers 12 to 24 hours before pickling them. Excess lime absorbed by the cucumbers must be removed to make safe pickles. To remove excess lime, drain the lime-water solution, rinse, and then resoak the cucumbers in fresh water for 1 hour. Repeat the rinsing and soaking steps two more times. To further improve pickle firmness, you may process cucumber pickles for 30 minutes in water at 180°F. This process also prevents spoilage, but the water temperature should not fall below 180°F. Use a candy or jelly thermometer to check the water temperature.

<br><br>Preventing spoilage

<br>Pickle products are subject to spoilage from microorganisms, particularly yeasts and molds, as well as enzymes that may affect flavor, color, and texture. Processing the pickles in a boiling-water canner will prevent both of these problems. Standard canning jars and self-sealing lids are recommended. Processing times and procedures will vary according to food acidity and the size of food pieces.</p>

                    <h1>Pickled Eggs</h1>
                    <p>There are no home canning directions for pickled eggs.  All of the following pickled egg recipes are for storage in the refrigerator.  Pickled eggs should never be at room temperature except for serving time, when they should be limited to no more than 2 hours in the temperature danger zone of 40 to 140 degrees F.

<br>Caution:  Home pickled eggs stored at room temperature have caused botulism.  For the report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), see http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4934a2.htm The Editorial Note in this report cautions against room temperature pickling and storage, also.  The CDC further cautions that to reduce the risk for botulism when pickling, food items should be washed and cooked adequately, and utensils, containers, and other surfaces in contact with food, including cutting boards and hands, should be cleaned thoroughly with soap and warm water. Containers (e.g., jars and lids) in which pickling will occur should be sterilized (e.g., placed in boiling water for a prescribed period). 

<br><br>PICKLING TIPS

<br>Pickled eggs are peeled, hard-cooked eggs in a solution consisting basically of vinegar, salt, spices, and perhaps other seasonings.  Pickling solutions are heated to boiling, simmered for 5 minutes, and poured over the peeled eggs.  Egg whites tend to be more tender if a boiling solution is used instead of room temperature solutions. 

<br>Eggs used for pickling should have clean, sound shells.  Small or medium eggs are usually a good choice for pickling so the seasoning can penetrate into the egg.  Fresh eggs are the best to use for pickling to ensure the highest quality possible since the eggs will be stored over a relatively long period of time. However, eggs at least a few days old will peel better after boiling.

<br><br>Cooking and Peeling Eggs

<br>According to the Georgia Egg Commission, the following method of hard-cooking facilitates peeling of ultra fresh eggs.  Make a pinhole in the large end of the egg, place the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan, and cover with cold water to an inch above the layer of eggs.  Place a lid on the pan and bring eggs to a boil.  Remove the pan of eggs from the burner, leaving the cover in place, and allow to sit for 15-18 minutes, adjusting time up or down 3 minutes for larger or smaller eggs.  Immediately remove eggs from the pan of hot water with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water for one minute.  In the meantime, bring hot water to simmering.  After one minute in ice water remove eggs back to the simmering water for ten seconds.  The ten second interval is important because this allows the shell to expand without expanding the rest of the egg.  Peel immediately by cracking the shells of the egg all over.  Roll each egg gently between hands to loosen the shell.  Peel, starting at the large end of the egg.  The peeling may take place under cold running water to help wash the shell off the egg and to minimize the shell breaking into the white.

<br>Another cooking method when you are less concerned about peeling of ultra-fresh eggs is to make a pinhole in the large end of the egg, place the eggs in a single layer in a saucepan, and cover with cold water to an inch above the layer of eggs.  Place a lid on the pan and bring eggs to a boil.  Turn down the heat and simmer for 15 minutes.  Place the eggs in cold water and when cool, remove shells.  Crack the shell of the egg all over.  Peel, starting at the large end of the egg.  The peeling may take place under cold running water to help wash the shell off the egg.

<br><br>Containers for the Eggs

<br>The container used for the eggs should be one that can be closed or sealed tightly; glass canning jars work well.  The eggs are to be completely covered with the pickling solution during storage.  A quart-size canning jar will hold about one dozen medium sized eggs.  For sterilizing glass jars, see Sterilization of Empty Jars.

<br><br>Storing Eggs

<br>After making the eggs, the eggs require some time to season (i.e., pick up the flavors from the pickling brine). Keep them refrigerated at all times. If small eggs are used, 1 to 2 weeks are usually allowed for seasoning to occur.  Medium or large eggs may require 2 to 4 weeks to become well seasoned.  Use the eggs within 3 to 4 months for best quality.

<br><br>RECIPES

<br>Each of these recipes uses 12 peeled, hard-cooked eggs.  The directions for each recipe are to bring all the ingredients except the eggs to a boil, reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes.  Pack no more than one dozen peeled, hard-cooked eggs loosely into a warm, pre-sterilized quart jar (or other similar size container which can be closed tightly).  There needs to be plenty of pickling solution, and enough to completely cover the eggs.  Pour the hot pickling solution over the eggs in the jar, cover, and refrigerate immediately.
