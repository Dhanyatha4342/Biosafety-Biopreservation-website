            <h1>JAMS AND JELLIES</h1>
            <p>Jelly, jam, preserves, conserves and marmalades are fruit products that are jellied or thickened. Most are preserved by sugar. Their individual characteristics depend on the kind of fruit used and the way it is prepared, the proportions of different ingredients in the mixture and the method of cooking. The characteristics of clarity or clearness, color, consistency and flavor are used to determine the quality of jellied products.

                They have long been used as a traditional method for preserving seasonal fruits, effectively prolonging their shelf life while encapsulating the vibrant essence of fresh, ripe flavors. Homemade tested recipes allow for a variety of fruits, spices, and flavorings to be combined to create unique and delightful spreads.

<br><br>Procedure: Sterilize canning jars and prepare two-piece canning lids according to manufacturer's directions.

<br><br>To prepare juice. Wash mint, crush leaves and stems or finely chop. Place in saucepan, add water and bring quickly to a boil. Remove from heat, cover and let stand 10 minutes. (A few drops of green food coloring can be added if desired.) Strain to remove mint. Discard mint.

<br><br>To make jelly. Measure 1-¾ cups mint juice into a large saucepot. Stir in the sugar and lemon juice. Place on high heat, stir constantly and bring to a full boil that cannot be stirred down. Add the liquid pectin and heat again to a full rolling boil. Boil hard for 1 minute. Remove from heat; quickly skim off foam.

<br>½ cup water
<br>¼ cup lemon juice
<br>½ cup raisins

<br><br>Procedure: Sterilize canning jars and prepare two-piece canning lids according to manufacturer's directions.

<br>To prepare fruit. Select tart apples. Sort and wash apples. Remove stem and blossom ends and core; do not pare. Chop apples fine.

<br><br>To make conserve. Combine apples, water, lemon juice, and raisins in a kettle. Add pectin and stir well.

<br>Yield: About 10 half-pint jars

<br><br>Please read Using Boiling Water Canners before beginning. If this is your first time canning, it is recommended that you read Principles of Home Canning.

<br><br>Procedure: Pour 3 quarts boiling water over figs. Let stand 15 minutes. Drain and discard liquid. Rinse figs in cold water and drain. Prepare syrup by mixing sugar, 1½ quarts water and lemon. Boil rapidly 10 minutes. Skim syrup; remove and discard lemon slices. Drop whole figs carefully into the boiling hot syrup, a few at a time, until all have been added. Cook rapidly until figs are translucent. Remove figs and place in shallow pan. Boil syrup until thick; the syrup must be boiled down until it becomes as thick as honey. Carefully pour the syrup over figs, cool and let stand 6 to 8 hours in the refrigerator.

<br><br>Sterilize canning jars. Reheat figs and syrup to boiling. Fill whole figs into hot jars and cover with hot syrup, leaving ¼ inch headspace. Wipe rims of jars with a dampened clean paper towel; adjust two-piece metal canning lids. Process in a Boiling Water Canner.</p>
